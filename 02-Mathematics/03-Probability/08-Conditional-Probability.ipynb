    "# Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as `P(A|B)` and read as \"the probability of `A` given `B`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for conditional probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where `P(A and B)` is the probability of both events `A` and `B` occurring together, and `P(B)` is the probability of event `B` occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is an important concept in probability theory and is used in many real-world applications, such as predicting the likelihood of a disease given certain symptoms, or the probability of a customer buying a product given their demographic information.\n",

    "`Solution:` Let `A` be the event that the ball was one of the first two balls drawn from the bag, and let `B` be the event that the ball is red. We want to find `P(A|B)`.\n",

    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate conditional probabilities. It describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related conditions that may be relevant to the event. It is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and philosopher.\n",

    "- `P(A)` is the prior probability of event `A`\n",
    "- `P(B)` is the prior probability of event `B`\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is widely used in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It can be used to update beliefs and make predictions based on new evidence. For example, in medical diagnosis, Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability that a patient has a particular disease given their symptoms and medical history.\n",
