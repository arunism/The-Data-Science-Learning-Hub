    "# Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Events in probability theory are subsets of a sample space, and can be thought of as outcomes of a random experiment. We can assign probabilities to events, which describe how likely they are to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elementary Event\n",
    "\n",
    "An elementary event is a single possible outcome of a random experiment. For example, when flipping a coin, the possible elementary events are getting heads or getting tails. Similarly, when rolling a dice, the possible elementary events are getting `1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compound Event\n",
    "\n",
    "A compound event is a combination of two or more elementary events. For example, in the case of rolling two dice, a compound event could be getting a sum of `7` or getting a sum of `9`. Another example of a compound event could be selecting two cards from a deck of cards and getting both cards of the same suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutually Explosive Event\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, when flipping a coin, getting heads and getting tails are mutually exclusive events because only one of them can happen on a single flip. Similarly, when rolling a dice, getting an odd number and getting an even number are mutually exclusive events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent Event\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent events are events in which the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. For example, when flipping a coin, getting heads on the first flip and getting heads on the second flip are independent events because the outcome of the first flip does not affect the outcome of the second flip. Similarly, when drawing two cards from a deck of cards, getting a heart on the first draw and getting a spade on the second draw are independent events because the outcome of the first draw does not affect the outcome of the second draw."

    "- **Probability of an event:** The probability of an event `A` is denoted by `P(A)` and is a number between `0` and `1`.\n",
    "- **Complement rule:** The probability of the complement of an event `A` is `1` minus the probability of `A`. That is, `P(not A) = 1 - P(A)`.\n",
    "- **Union rule:** The probability of the union of two events `A` and `B` is given by `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)`.\n",
    "- **Intersection rule:** The probability of the intersection of two events `A` and `B` is given by `P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)`, where `P(B|A)` is the conditional probability of `B` given that `A` has occurred.\n",
    "- **Addition rule:** The addition rule of probability states that the probability of the union of two events `A` and `B` is given by `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)` where `P(A and B)` denotes the probability of the intersection of events `A` and `B`.\n",
    "- **Multiplication rule:** The probability of the joint occurrence of two or more events is given by `P(A and B and C and ...) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(C|A and B) * ...`, where the conditional probabilities are given by the product rule.\n",
    "- **Conditional probability:** The conditional probability of an event `B` given that an event `A` has occurred is denoted by `P(B|A)` and is given by `P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)`, provided that `P(A) > 0`.\n",
    "- **Law of total probability:** Let `A1, A2, ...`, An be a partition of the sample space. Then, for any event `B`, the probability of `B` is given by the law of total probability: `P(B) = P(B|A1) * P(A1) + P(B|A2) * P(A2) + ... + P(B|An) * P(An)`.\n",

    "## Conditional Probability\n",

    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. It is denoted by `P(A|B)`, which represents the probability of event `A` occurring given that event `B` has occurred.\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that the probability of selecting urn `A` is `1/2`, because there are two urns and we are equally likely to select either one. We also know that the probability of selecting a red ball from urn `A` is `3/5`, because urn `A` contains `3` red balls and `5` total balls.
