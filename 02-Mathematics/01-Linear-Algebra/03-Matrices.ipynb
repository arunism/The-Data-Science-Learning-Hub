    "In linear algebra, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or elements arranged in rows and columns. It is a fundamental mathematical object used to represent and work with linear transformations, systems of linear equations, and various mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as A, B, or C. The dimensions of a matrix are given by the number of rows and columns it has. If a matrix has m rows and n columns, it is said to have dimensions m x n.\n",
