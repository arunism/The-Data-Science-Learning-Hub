    "# Method Overriding in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding refers to the ability of a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. When a method in a subclass has the same name and parameters as a method in its parent class, the subclass method will override the parent class method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To override a method in Python, the subclass method must have the same name and parameters as the parent class method. When an object of the subclass calls the method, it will use the implementation provided in the subclass, rather than the one in the superclass."
